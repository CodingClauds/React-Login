# Console.log(in)

I focused on building out a login component, that emulates a sign in with error handling and admin login that will bring you to a new page. This is currently done in a naive approach, but the point still stands. It's meant to illustrate how a user would go from a sign in page to a new page with the right credentials.


# Getting Started with Create React App

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.
